# Operating-Systems-ID1206

The course provides knowledge of the principles of and how one can implement

abstractions of hardware
virtualisation of resources and timetabling of assignments; mainly as regards execution, memory and persistent storage.
The structure of an operating system is studied to increase the knowledge of these concepts and also give skills in efficient use of the abstraction level that an operating system offers.

Intended learning outcomes *

Having passed the course, the student should be able to:

explain how multi-threaded processes are structured
explain how an operating system can handle several processes at the same time
implement parts of the functions of an operating system.
For higher grades, the student should also be able to

explain how virtualisation of memory is implemented
explain how memory management is implemented
explain properties for different scheduling algorithms
explain properties for different types of process communication
explain implementation of more advanced file system.

Course Disposition

The course consists of 12-16 lectures to which practical smaller assignments be connected. The practical assignments are intended to give an increased understanding of the concepts that are presented as well as to give the practical skills that is required to satisfy the aim of the course.

The course also has a larger assignment that should be carried out during the course. The assignment should give increased understanding of how an operating system is built in practice and how it functions.
